# populate

Draft for discussion.

This issue was closed : <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/6547>

Is this extension package useful ?

{populate} provides stricter wrappers around `dplyr::mutate()`:

- `populate()` makes sure the input’s ptype is preserved
  - no column type change
  - no column addition
  - no column deletion (`mutate()` can delete with `NULL`)
  - cast by default, assert optionally
- `collate()` only creates new columns

Do we need more or should we keep it simple?

- `abrogate()` to remove columns ?
- `sublimate()` like `populate()` but allow ptype change (doesn’t allow
  new col creation) ?
- `summarize()` variants ?

Is it better to use a subclass of data frame (as in linked github issue)
so we can make safe versions of everything including functions like
`count()`, `unnest()`, joins …

We’d lose autocomplete of new args, maybe more confusing than having new
verbs ?

## Installation

You can install the development version of populate like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("cynkra/populate")
```

## Examples

``` r
library(populate)

data <- tibble::tibble(
  a = letters[1:2],
  b = c(1,2), 
  c = factor(letters[1:2]), 
  d = as.Date(c("2022-01-01", "2022-01-02")), 
  e = vctrs::list_of(cars)
)

#> ℹ Found in data: `a`.
#> ℹ Do you need `populate()`?
